# ECEN 323 Labs

Lab 1: In this lab you will become familiar with the Vivado tools used in ECEN 323, the ECEN 323 lab submission process, and review your SystemVerilog RTL coding skills that you learned in ECEN 220. You will be using SystemVerilog to design all of your laboratory assignments this semester. It is essential that you have strong RTL SystemVerilog design skills. In this lab you will review your SystemVerilog RTL design practices and strengthen your RTL skills by creating several SystemVerilog modules. You will demonstrate your SystemVerilog skills by downloading a circuit on the Basys3 FPGA board used in ECEN 220. Much of this laboratory assignment will be a review and the amount of time you spend on this lab will depend on you famliarity with Unix, GitHub, and your SystemVerilog RTL design experience.


Lab 2: An Arithmetic/Logic Unit or ALU is an important component of any processor system. This unit is the “brains” of the processor and performs the arithmetic functions such as addition and subtraction as well as logical functions such as AND/OR. You will create an ALU in this laboratory that you will use for your RISC-V processor in a later lab. You will also use this ALU to implement a simple “calculator” on the FPGA.


Lab 3: The register file is an another important component of any processor system. The register file stores the values of the registers used by the processor. Almost all instructions read from and/or write to the register file. You will create a register file in this laboratory that you will include in your RISC-Processor used in a later lab.


Lab 4: In this laboratory, you will learn more about assembly language programming and learn how to use the RARS RISC-V simulator. This RISC-V instruction-set simulator will allow you to simulate the executions of individual instructions operating on the RISC-V processor. Instruction set simulators are helpful for a number of purposes including understanding the details of an instruction set, improving low-level processor performance, and understanding execution time.


Lab 5: For this laboratory you will design the simplified datapath for the RISC-V processor in SystemVerilog. Your dataflow implementation will be used in the next lab where you will design the controller for this datapath.


Lab 6: For this laboratory you will design the control unit for a simplified, multi-cycle, non-pipelined datapath you designed in the previous laboratory. Your simple RISC-V processor will be able to execute simple assembly language programs.


Lab 7: For this laboratory you will integrate your processor into an I/O system and download your processor onto the FPGA board. Your processor will be able to control several I/O interfaces on the FPGA board.


Lab 8: For this laboratory you will design a pipelined datapath and control for the RISC-V processor. This pipelined version of the processor will not implement hazard detection or forwarding.


Lab 9: For this laboratory you will modify your pipelined processor from the previous lab to implement forwarding and hazard detection/stalling.


Lab 10: For this laboratory you will integrate the forwarding processor from the previous lab into the I/O sub-system and download your processor to the BASYS3 board. You will also learn how to use the VGA interface and change the program within your processor.


Lab 11: For this laboratory you will modify your pipelined processor from the previous lab to implement several new instructions and prepare your processor for download. You will also modify your Fibonacci code from a previous lab to execute on your processor.


Lab 12: For this laboratory you will write a custom program for your RISC-V processor that implements a simple game on the Basys 3 board.
