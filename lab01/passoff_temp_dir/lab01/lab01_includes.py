# This is a python file that specifies the names of the files that are included
# as part of your submission. This file is used to determine which files to
# compile as part of the lab test. If you named your files as instructed
# in the laboratory then you should not need to chage this file.

# This is a python dictionary specifying a "key" representing a keyword
# for each required file in the lab. The "value" is the file name 
# associated with the required submission file. The filenames can
# be changed to reflect changes in your submission filenames.
